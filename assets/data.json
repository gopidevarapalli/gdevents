On April 29, 2016, the FDA approved Acadias drug, Nuplazid, for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinsons disease psychosis.[5] Nuplazid is the trade name for Acadias proprietary molecule, pimavanserin, a selective serotonin inverse agonist preferentially targeting 5-HT2a receptors. Acadia had partnered with Biovail in the late-stage clinical testing of the drug, which showed trial failures as of 2009.[1][6][7] Acadia is running multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials with pimavanserin in several central nervous system conditions: dementia-related psychosis[8], major depressive disorder[9], schizophrenia inadequate response[10], and schizophrenia negative symptoms.",
